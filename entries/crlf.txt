crlf

/kerl@f/ , /krul@f/ , /CRLF/ , n. (often capitalized as CRLF ) A carriage
return (CR, ASCII 0001101) followed by a line feed (LF, ASCII 0001010). More
loosely, whatever it takes to get you from the end of one line of text to
the beginning of the next line. See newline. Under Unix influence this usage
has become less common (Unix uses a bare line feed as its CRLF ).
