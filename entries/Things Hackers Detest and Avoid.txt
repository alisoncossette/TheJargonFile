Things Hackers Detest and Avoid

All the works of Microsoft. Smurfs, Ewoks, and other forms of offensive
cuteness. Bureaucracies. Stupid people. Easy listening music. Television
(with occasional exceptions for cartoons, movies, and good SF like Star Trek

COBOL. BASIC. Character-based menu interfaces.
