userops

Combination of "user" and "operations". Someone who is not a software
developer or a systems administrator, but who runs their own internet
services from a server. This might also be called lightweight systems
administration, in which software tools make the administration tasks
simpler and so do not require the traditionally detailed knowledge of
a systems administrator.

The term was invented by Christopher Allan Webber and Deb Nicholson at
FOSDEM 2015.
