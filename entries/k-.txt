k-

pref. [rare; poss fr. kilo- prefix] Extremely. Rare among hackers, but quite
common among crackers and warez d00dz in compounds such as k-kool /Kkool/ ,
k-rad /Krad/ , and k-awesome /Kaw`sm/. Also used to intensify negatives;
thus, k-evil , k-lame , k-screwed , and k-annoying. Overuse of this prefix,
or use in more formal or technical contexts, is considered an indicator of
lamer status.
