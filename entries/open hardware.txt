open hardware

Hardware whose design is available under terms comparable to free software.
That is that the user has the right to study, build and make improvements
to the hardware design without needing to pay royalties or falling foul of
counterfeiting or copyright laws.  Early examples of open hardware were
the Arduino microcontroller and Novena motherboard.
