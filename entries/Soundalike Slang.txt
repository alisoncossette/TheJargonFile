Soundalike Slang

Hackers will often make rhymes or puns in order to convert an ordinary word or phrase into something more interesting. It is considered particularly flavorful if the phrase is bent so as to include some other jargon word; thus the computer hobbyist magazine Dr. Dobb's Journal is almost always referred to among hackers as Dr. Frob's Journal or simply Dr. Frob's. Terms of this kind that have been in fairly wide use include names for newspapers: Boston Herald  Horrid (or Harried) Boston Globe  Boston Glob Houston (or San Francisco) Chronicle  the Crocknicle (or the Comical) New York Times  New York Slime Wall Street Journal  Wall Street Urinal However, terms like these are often made up on the spur of the moment. Standard examples include: Data General  Dirty Genitals IBM 360  IBM Three-Sickly Government Property  Do Not Duplicate (on keys)  Government Duplicity  Do Not Propagate for historical reasons  for hysterical raisins Margaret Jacks Hall (the CS building at Stanford)  Marginal Hacks Hall Microsoft  Microsloth Internet Explorer  Internet Exploiter FrontPage  AffrontPage VB.NET  VB Nyet Lotus Notes  Lotus Bloats Microsoft Outlook  Microsoft Outhouse Linux  Linsux FreeBSD  FreeLSD C#  C Flat This is not really similar to the Cockney rhyming slang it has been compared to in the past, because Cockney substitutions are opaque whereas hacker punning jargon is intentionally transparent.
