/blit/ , vt. 1. [common] To copy a large array of bits from one part of a computer's memory to another part, particularly when the memory is being used to determine what is shown on a display screen. The storage allocator picks through the table and copies the good parts up into high memory, and then blits it all back down again. See bitblt , BLT , dd , cat , blast , snarf. More generally, to perform some operation (such as toggling) on a large array of bits while moving them. 2.
