App Store

n. An App Store, sometimes also known as a Software Center or Software
Manager, is a graphical user interface which allows the user to
conveniently download and install new applications onto their computer
or mobile device. App Stores can be very convenient but are often
proprietary and may enable a particular company to control and censor
what types of application non-technical users may run on their systems
- typically in accordance with an American west coast morality. App
stores have sometimes been described as a type of MITM attack on
software distribution, allowing companies to insert themselves as
rent-seeking trolls on a virtual toll bridge between the users and
producers of software.
