universal greeting time

UGT (acronym). A time-agnostic greeting phrase used on IRC channels.
Since participants on IRC are often international saying "good morning"
or "good evening" can seem odd if you're not in the same time zone.
"Good (UGT) morning" or "good morning (UGT)" may be used as a
substitute, and similar for other times of day.
