Spoken inarticulations

Words such as mumble, sigh, and groan are spoken in places where their
referent might more naturally be used. It has been suggested that this usage
derives from the impossibility of representing such noises on a comm link or
in electronic mail, MUDs, and IRC channels (interestingly, the same sorts of
constructions have been showing up with increasing frequency in comic
strips).
