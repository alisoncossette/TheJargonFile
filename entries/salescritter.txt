salescritter

/saylskri`tr/ , n. Pejorative hackerism for a computer salesperson. Hackers tell the following joke: Q.What'sthedifferencebetweenaused-cardealeranda computersalesman? A.Theused-cardealerknowshe'slying.[Someversionsadd: ...andprobablyknowshowtodrive.] This reflects the widespread hacker belief that salescritters are self-selected for stupidity (after all, if they had brains and the inclination to use them, they'd be in programming). The terms salesthing and salesdroid are also common. Compare marketroid , suit , droid.
