megaleak

The leaking or "exfiltration" of a large amount of otherwise private
information from a military, government, academic or corporate
organisation.  In the 20th century such leaks would have required an
improbable amount of photographing or photocopying, but by the early
21st century industrial quantities of information could be leaked via
common computer media formats such as DVDs or USB drives.
