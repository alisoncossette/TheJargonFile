frobnitz

/frobnits/ , pl. , frobnitzem , /frobnitzm/ , frobni , /frob'ni:/ , n.
[TMRC] An unspecified physical object, a widget. Also refers to electronic
black boxes. This rare form is usually abbreviated to frotz , or more
commonly to frob. Also used are frobnule ( /frobn[y]ool/ ) and frobule (
/frobyool/ ). Starting perhaps in 1979, frobozz /fr@-boz/ (plural:
frobbotzim /fr@-botzm/ ) has also become very popular, largely through its
exposure as a name via Zork. These variants can also be applied to
nonphysical objects, such as data structures. For related amusement, see the
Encyclopedia Frobozzica. Pete Samson, compiler of the original TMRC lexicon,
adds, Under the TMRC [railroad] layout were many storage boxes, managed (in
1958) by David R. Sawyer. Several had fanciful designations written on them,
such as Frobnitz Coil Oil. Perhaps DRS intended Frobnitz to be a proper
name, but the name was quickly taken for the thing. This was almost
certainly the origin of the term.
