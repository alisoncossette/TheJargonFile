fscking

/fus'king/ , /eff'seeking/ , adj. [Usenet; very common] Fucking, in the
expletive sense (it refers to the Unix filesystem-repair command fsck (8) ,
of which it can be said that if you have to use it at all you are having a
bad day). Originated on scary devil monastery and the bofh.net newsgroups,
but became much more widespread following the passage of CDA.
