Politics

The only safe generalization is that hackers tend to be rather
anti-authoritarian, so on a political compass chart they tend
to be somewhere within the libertarian left or libertarian right
quadrants.  Since technology impacts upon so many aspects of
society it is rare for hackers to claim to be entirely apolitical,
and those that do make such a claim are typically just having
their viewpoints manipulated by popular media, which invariably
does have a political agenda.
