Politics

Formerly vaguely liberal-moderate, more recently moderate-to-neoconservative
(hackers too were affected by the collapse of socialism). There is a strong
libertarian contingent which rejects conventional left-right politics
entirely. The only safe generalization is that hackers tend to be rather
anti-authoritarian; thus, both paleoconservatism and hard leftism are rare.
Hackers are far more likely than most non-hackers to either (a) be
aggressively apolitical or (b) entertain peculiar or idiosyncratic political
ideas and actually try to live by them day-to-day.
