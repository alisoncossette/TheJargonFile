literate programming

The practice of embedding source code within a larger quantity of
documentation written in natural language (typically English).
The intention is to make the code more readable and to render
explicit the author's beliefs and intentions as to what the code
should be doing. Literate program typically involves more elaborated
explanations than occasional comment lines. It was originally
proposed by Donald Knuth. Also see self-documenting code.
