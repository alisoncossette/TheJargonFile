teledildonics

/tel`@dildo'niks/ , n. Sex in a computer simulated virtual reality, esp.
computer-mediated sexual interaction between the VR presences of two humans.
This practice is not yet possible except in the rather limited form of
erotic conversation on MUDs and the like. The term, however, is widely
recognized in the VR community as a ha ha only serious projection of things
to come. When we can sustain a multi-sensory surround good enough for
teledildonics, then we'll know we're getting somewhere. See also hot chat.
