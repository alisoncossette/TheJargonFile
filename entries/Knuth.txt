Knuth

/kanooth/ , n. [Donald E. Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming ]
Mythically, the reference that answers all questions about data structures
or algorithms. A safe answer when you do not know: I think you can find that
in Knuth. Contrast the literature. See also bible. There is a Donald Knuth
home page at http://Sunburn.Stanford.EDU/~knuth/.
