rogue

n. A Dungeons-and-Dragons-like game using character graphics, written under BSD Unix and subsequently ported to other Unix systems. The original BSD curses (3) screen-handling package was hacked together by Ken Arnold primarily to support games, and the development of rogue (6) popularized its use; it has since become one of Unix's most important and heavily used application libraries. Nethack, Omega, Larn, Angband, and an entire subgenre of computer dungeon games (all known as roguelikes ) all took off from the inspiration provided by rogue (6) ; the popular Windows game Diablo, though graphics-intensive, has very similar play logic. See also nethack , moria , Angband. 2.
