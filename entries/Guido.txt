Guido

/gweedo/ , /khweedo/ Without qualification, Guido van Rossum (author of Python ). Note that Guido answers to English /gweedo/ but in Dutch it's /khweedo/. Mythically, Guido's most important attribute besides Python itself is Guido's time machine, a device he is reputed to possess because of the unnerving frequency with which user requests for new features have been met with the response I just implemented that last night.... See BDFL.
