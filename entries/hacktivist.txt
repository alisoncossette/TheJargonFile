hacktivist

n. [Combination of "hacker" and "activist"] A term used to describe a hacker whose activity has overtly political aims.  In the mainstream media "hacktivist" is often used as a synonym for "computer criminal" or "terrorist" since regimes who don't like innovation are typically hostile towards the idea of any political change taking place - especially if cleverly augmented by technology.
