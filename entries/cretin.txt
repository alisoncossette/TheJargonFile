cretin

/kretin/ , /kreetn/ , n. Congenital loser ; an obnoxious person; someone who
can't do anything right. It has been observed that many American hackers
tend to favor the British pronunciation /kretin/ over standard American
/kreetn/ ; it is thought this may be due to the insidious phonetic influence
of Monty Python's Flying Circus.
