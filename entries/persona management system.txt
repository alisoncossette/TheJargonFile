persona management system

A system which permits a single human user to manage and control
multiple semi-automated sock puppets in order to spread government
and/or corporate propaganda or to interfere with the civic activities of
netizens.  The persona management system provides back-stories,
generates plausible looking social media profile pages and allows the
human operator to quickly familiarize themselves with the current
talking points and primary targets for disruption.
