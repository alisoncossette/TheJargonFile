copyright maximalists

Individuals or organisations who seek to enforce copyright to the
maximum possible extent, beyond any level which could be deemed as being
reasonable or proportionate.  For example, maximalists seek to have
users disconnected from the internet after three accusations of
copyright infringement or may try to sue university students for
hundreds of thousands of dollars after they are discovered to have
downloaded a few mp3 files.  Maximalists always vigorously reject any
notion of the "fair use" of copyrighted materials and prefer prosecution
rather than negotiation.
