Man In The Middle (MITM) attack

This is a type of malicious communications interception in which an
interloper inserts themselves between two communicating parties. The
motivation for conducting such an attack is typically in order to
obtain personal, financial or political gain. They may merely collect
data, or insert their own packets into the conversation.
