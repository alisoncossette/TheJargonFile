meta

/met@/ , /mayt@/ , /meet@/ , pref. [from analytic philosophy] One level of
description up. A metasyntactic variable is a variable in notation used to
describe syntax, and meta-language is language used to describe language.
This is difficult to explain briefly, but much hacker humor turns on
deliberate confusion between meta-levels. See hacker humor.
