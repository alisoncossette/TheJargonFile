Sexual Habits

Hackerdom easily tolerates a much wider range of sexual and lifestyle
variation than the mainstream culture. It includes a relatively large gay
and bisexual contingent. Hackers are somewhat more likely to live in
polygynous or polyandrous relationships, practice open marriage, or live in
communes or group houses. In this, as in general appearance, hackerdom
semi-consciously maintains counterculture values.
