kludge

A crock that works. (A long-ago Datamation article by Jackson Granholme
similarly said: An ill-assorted collection of poorly matching parts, forming
a distressing whole. ) 3. v. To use a kludge to get around a problem. I've
kludged around it for now, but I'll fix it up properly later. This word
appears to have derived from Scots kludge or kludgie for a common toilet,
via British military slang. It apparently became confused with U.S. kluge
during or after World War II; some Britons from that era use both words in
definably different ways, but kluge is now uncommon in Great Britain. Kludge
in Commonwealth hackish differs in meaning from kluge in that it lacks the
positive senses; a kludge is something no Commonwealth hacker wants to be
associated too closely with. Also, kludge is more widely known in British
mainstream slang than kluge is in the U.S.
