hop

One file transmission in a series required to get a file from point A to
point B on a store-and-forward network. On such networks (including the old
UUCP network and and FidoNet ), an important inter-machine metric is the
number of hops in the shortest path between them, which can be more
significant than their geographical separation. See bang path. 2. v.
