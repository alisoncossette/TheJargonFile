Christmas tree packet

n. A packet with every single option set for whatever protocol is in use.
See kamikaze packet , Chernobyl packet. (The term doubtless derives from a
fanciful image of each little option bit being represented by a
different-colored light bulb, all turned on.) Compare Godzillagram.
