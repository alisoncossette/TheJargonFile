leech

v. To download a file across any kind of internet link. Hop on IRC later so
I can leech some MP3s from you. Used to describe activities ranging from
FTP, to IRC DCC-send, to ICQ file requests, to Napster searches (but never
to downloading email with file attachments; the implication is that the
download is the result of a browse or search of some sort of file server).
Seems to be a holdover from the early 1990s when Toronto had a very active
BBS and warez scene. Synonymous with snarf (sense 2), and contrast snarf
(sense 4).
